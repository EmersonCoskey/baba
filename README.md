# Foam - Forge, only abstracted more.

## A relatively "thin" modding framework that aims to be declarative, extensible, and functional without taking power away from the user.

### Featuring:
 - Module system for grouping game objects based on their place in the mod, rather than by type.
 - Easy declaration of game objects
    -> "Declaration Modifiers" for simple datagen
 - Extremely type-safe system to catch bugs early
 - Much more on the way!

Documentation coming soon!™️
